The pharmaceutical treatments category is further divided into chemical treatments, such as permethrin-based solutions, and non-chemical treatments, which are gaining popularity due to concerns over pesticide resistance. Innovations such as the development of new chemical and natural alternatives are expected to fuel market growth, with companies investing in research and development to improve efficacy and reduce side effects. Geographically, North America holds the largest market share due to a high prevalence of head lice infestations in schools and among children, along with strong healthcare infrastructure.
